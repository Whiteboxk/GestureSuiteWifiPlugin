# GestureSuiteWifiPlugin
This project is a Gesture Suite plug in that helps Gesture Suite change the wifi state for devices running Android 10 and above

Google has restricted developers to only upload apps that target Android 10 and above. At the same time Google blocked apps that target Android 10 and above from changing the wifi state. That is why it's not possible for Gesture Suite to change the wifi state on its own. 


GestureSuiteWifiPlugin is able to change the wifi state because it's targeting Android Pie. For that reason it is not allowed to be published on Google Play Store. The code is freely available for everyone to inspect and confirm that the app does nothing more than changing the wifi state.
